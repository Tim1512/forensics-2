Cloud based cyber forensic tool using block chain technology
============================================================

This tool was used to find the origin behind the attacks on (a.o.):

* The german Bundestag
* Yahoo
* The american voting registers

Since it is cloud based, it works with binaries as well as scripts or other data (such as captured network traffic).

To analyze data, just run:

    ./forensic.py [DATA DIR]

The output will show the most likely origin of the attack.
